# Baby_R2D2_Controller

***THIS REPO IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is a controller for the Baby R2 unit from Michael Bradeley (https://www.patreon.com/mrbaddeley).  It is currently designed for controlling the three servos and a speaker using an ESP8266 nodemcu board.  User control is done using the Blynk IoT Platform.  User control is done using a custom Blynk App which can downloaded by scanning the QR code at the bottom of this readme into the Blynk application on your mobile phone.
